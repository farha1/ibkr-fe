# IB-KR Frontend

This is the frontend codebase for [https://ib-kr.com](https://ib-kr.com).

## Project Overview

This project is motivated by my own problem. I find it difficult to read long news articles. And then, I thought of an idea, “why not just summarize the news into short points?”. By leveraging AI, I was able to realize that idea. Now I feel happy because I can get information without feeling burdened by reading long articles. We offer a new experience in reading news. For busy people who want to stay informed.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
